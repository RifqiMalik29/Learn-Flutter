## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my progress while learning Flutter and Dart through the Udemy course.  
The course teaches how to build beautiful, responsive, and fully native mobile apps for **iOS** and **Android**, covering both fundamentals and advanced topics.  

By following along, I will build multiple projects, learn to integrate device features, and eventually publish apps to the App Store and Google Play.
